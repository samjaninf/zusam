### Pull requests

Please target any pull requests to the `next` branch. This branch will be merged into `master` with each release.

### Setting up dev environment

Start by cloning the repo. Go to the folder you want to put it inside then:

`git clone https://github.com/zusam/zusam.git`

Go into the zusam directory and build the dev version:

`cd zusam && dev/start-dev-container`

You might get an error that it can't find the container that it just built. This is often related to a podman installation. To get around this, run the make command specifically targeting docker before running the start-dev-container script:

`make dev container_pgrm=docker`

You'll now be inside the container, in the zusam directory. `cd app` to get to the front end app directory, then run `npm install --save-dev` to install the npm packages.

Next, compile the webapp and copy to the public directory with:

`npm run build; rm -r ../public/*.{js,css,map,png}; cp -r dist/* ../public/`

Now install the composer dependencies by running:

`cd /zusam/api && php bin/composer install`

Now exit the container with ctrl + D and then run the container using repo files using:

`dev/start-test-container`

You should now be able to access Zusam on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). A user `zusam` with password `zusam` is created by default.

Any code updates you make in the `api` directory should be reflected immediately in this running instance. For the web app in the `app` directory, after making changes you will need to rerun the command to build and copy to the public directory: 

`npm run build; rm -r ../public/*.{js,css,map,png}; cp -r dist/* ../public/`
